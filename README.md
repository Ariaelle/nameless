A work in progress rendering engine made using the Vulkan API, GLFW, GLM, and tinyobjloader.

Currently has support for loading .obj files with tinyobjloader https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader.

Utilizes blinn-phong rendering for a simple lighting model and point-lights. 

Animation system and more complex rendering techniques and shaders are currently works in progress, as is switching object loading to utilize assimp.
